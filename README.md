# SolarVision - "Predicting Solar Energy Generation and Revenue Estimation using Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis"


This project involves using weather data of well known cities of India to develop a machine 
learning-based solar energy prediction model. A dataset is constructed by combining 
data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant variables of cities with 
data on solar energy generation. This dataset is used to train a machine learning 
model that can predict solar energy generation for each month using time series analysis.
Once the model is trained and validated, it is deployed to a user interface. The user 
interface allows users to input location data and view the predicted energy generation 
for that location. The interface will also include information on the price of extra energy sold 
to the government of each state in the country. This information will be used to estimate 
the revenue that can be generated by selling extra energy. The project has the potential to 
be very useful for those interested in solar energy generation and selling extra energy to the 
government or private power grids. The predicted energy generation and revenue estimates 
can help users make informed decisions about the feasibility of solar energy projects in 
different locations. The machine learning-based approach ensures that the predictions are 
accurate and reliable, making the project a valuable tool for those interested in solar 
energy.
